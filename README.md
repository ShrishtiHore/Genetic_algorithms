# Genetic_algorithms

SInce cells are the basic building blocks of every living being all the living being =s have chromosomes in their dna. If the chromosomes are represented in binary strings as 0's and 1's then they encode specific traits. 
According to Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection the living organisms that are adjusted to change in the environment are the strongest due to natural adaptation.
We can understand the topic in more detail by solving the Knapsack problem in the link https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/notes/the-knapsack-problem/
The crossover of the two parent species and the mutation of the offspring along with their adaptation to the changes result in a successful genetic algorithm.
We are using TPOT library ie; tree based pipeline optimisation technique built on scikit learn lib.
Here in the given program we are going to analyze the genetic algorithms to the gamma radiation.
